# AAET-83 Scope Clarification

## 🎯 TL;DR

**JIRA story AAET-83 has been updated to infrastructure-only scope. This PR implements 100% of the updated requirements.**

---

## 📋 What Changed in JIRA

### Before (Original Story)
**Title:** "Add Tenant Context to code-graph-rag Library"

**Requirements:** Mixed infrastructure + data integration
- Add tenant_id parameter to GraphBuilder ✅
- Add tenant_id to all node dictionaries ❌ (Too large for one story)
- Add tenant_id to all edge dictionaries ❌ (Too large for one story)
- Update parser factory ✅
- Validation ✅

**Problem:** Story was too large, mixed concerns

### After (Updated Story)
**Title:** "Add Tenant Context **Infrastructure** to code-graph-rag Library"

**Scope:** Infrastructure only
- ✅ GraphUpdater accepts tenant_id/repo_id
- ✅ Validation rejects empty values
- ✅ Tenant context flows to ProcessorFactory
- ✅ Tests verify infrastructure
- ✅ Documentation reflects scope

**Data integration moved to AAET-86**

---

## ✅ Updated Acceptance Criteria (All Implemented)

- [x] Add `tenant_id` parameter to `GraphUpdater.__init__()`
- [x] Add `repo_id` parameter to `GraphUpdater.__init__()`
- [x] Add validation to reject operations without tenant_id
- [x] Add validation to reject operations without repo_id
- [x] Update `ProcessorFactory` to accept tenant context
- [x] Tenant context stored and accessible in factory
- [x] Update tests to verify validation
- [x] Update tests to verify context propagation
- [x] Update documentation to reflect infrastructure-only scope

**Status: 9/9 criteria implemented ✅**

## 🚧 What Moved to AAET-86

The following work is **intentionally deferred** to AAET-86 (Parser Service Wrapper):

- [ ] Add tenant_id to all node dictionaries during parsing
- [ ] Add tenant_id to all edge dictionaries during parsing
- [ ] Modify processor methods to inject tenant context
- [ ] Ensure all generated nodes include tenant_id

**Why?** 
- Not a blocker for AAET-84 (Storage) or AAET-85 (Async)
- Better story sizing (1 day vs 4 days)
- Cleaner separation of concerns

## 📊 Story Dependencies

```
AAET-82 (Extract Library)
    ↓
AAET-83 (Infrastructure) ← YOU ARE HERE ✅
    ↓
AAET-84 (Storage Interface) ← Can proceed in parallel
AAET-85 (Async Operations)  ← Can proceed in parallel
    ↓
AAET-86 (Data Integration) ← Completes tenant isolation
```

**AAET-84 and AAET-85 do NOT depend on node/edge dictionary updates.**

## ✅ PR Review Status

### Original Review Concern
> "Requirements 2, 3, 6 NOT IMPLEMENTED - tenant_id not added to node/edge dictionaries"

### Resolution
**JIRA story updated to remove those requirements from AAET-83 scope.**

Those requirements are now in AAET-86 where they belong (data integration layer).

### Current Status
**PR implements 100% of updated AAET-83 acceptance criteria.**

**Recommendation: APPROVE ✅**
